This is a card-based roleplaying game where players collaborate to put together the setting, plot, and characters of the game using the special Saga Shuffle cards.  You use the Saga Shuffle specific cards to set up the basic setting, plot, and characters.  You build up a proper story from these basic building blocks and roleplay through this tale using the regular ("poker") deck to add the uncertainty of chance to your character's actions.

  -

  
1c. Characterizing the Players
  -Deal one Origin card, one Class card, and one Desire card to each player.  This gives a start to making their characters.
  -(More than one Character per player is possible, but this is considered a more difficult level of play.)

1d. Developing the Setting, Plot, and Characters
  -The players collaborate to form the setting, plot, and characters from the Saga Shuffle cards.
  -The plot needs at least one protagonist character and one antagonist character.

3. Actually Playing the Game (Using the Regular Deck)

3a. Actions in Play
-Actions that affect the plot require cards - played against the deck or played against the opposing player.
-Specify your action and the plausible and clear result from said action for success or failure of the action.
  -7a. Actions Requiring Card Use
    -Cards are how you influence the plot.
    -There are two kinds of actions that require use of the Regular Deck:
      -Actions that don't have an opposing party (like spot checks, picking locks or fighting bears)
	-These require the player of the character putting down cards against an equal number drawn from the regular deck.
      -Actions that oppose some other party (like pick-pocketing a guard, dueling for love, or using diplomacy).

3b. Starting Play
  -Player clockwise from dealer says their character is going to do an action and puts down one of the six card that was dealt earlier. 
  -The character succeeds at their action if the card played is higher in number than the competing card drawn from the deck or played from the opposing player's hand. 
  -Cards replenished 
  
  
      
  7b. Regular Playing Card Rules
    -Each player can only put down one card for each action unless they use an Advantage card.
{
    -Rules for using the Advantage cards:
      -Using an Advantage card adds a card to that action.
      -If the player fails that action, they lose Advantage card.  But if the player wins, they keep the Advantage card to use again.
      -Other player(s) who oppose the action must match the number of cards put down by the player with the Advantage card.
}  
    -Getting the highest number means that that character's action succeeds.
      -(Each player's number is a sum of the cards they put down.)
    -Every player has a turn in a round, starting clock-wise from the Dealer.
    -No one gets any new cards until they are dealt out at the beginning of the next Complication.
      
  7c. Final Outcome Of Action
    -S
    -The Dice cards categorize the final consequences of the conflict
      -ie. Gain or loss of Regular Deck cards and/or Advantage cards.
    -Divide the Dice cards into winning (4, 5, 6) and losing (1, 2, 3) cards.
    -Lay out each three (shuffled) face-down side-by-side.
      -If the character succeeded in their action, the player chooses one of the winning cards (ie. 4, 5, 6).
      -If the character failed in their action, the player draws one of the losing cards (ie. 1, 2, 3).
    -Apply the Dice card.
    -Continue roleplaying until next conflict or check.

-There isn't any "winner", just a good story.
