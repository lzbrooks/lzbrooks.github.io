Tips and Tricks:
Surrender yourself to metaphor
Double up
 Hook layer/Real layer of plot
Throw yourself a curve
Double up, part two
 Separate parallel plots
  eg. One physical, one personal
Don't Panic
 A plot is a structure
 The story is fueled by the characters

Little List of Plot Twists:
Have to work with someone they'd rather not
Victims=Villains and vice versa
The NPCs won't help until you help them
The PCs know the villain personally
Pacifict Run
No access to usual resources
The villain is a recurring foil
Previous party failed, left their inventory
Keep the civilians safe
No build up - sudden toss into the pan
Must pretend to be someone else
Must decide which evil to thwart
 Which innocents to rescue
 Which values or ideals to uphold
Must sacrifice for others
Don't solve the problem, just render aid
One PC is(or presumed) some savior/patsy
Have competing party on the adventure
